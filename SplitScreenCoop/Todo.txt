Summary:
Immediate stuff that can be worked on:
- menu for current settings: alwayssplit, preferredsplitmode (for the 2 people out there who like vertical split)
- smoother camera following
- attempt at 3 and 4 camera modes
- attempt at splitting the game in 2 or more windows, 2 or more monitors.

Stuff related to the self-sufficient-coop, aka nonjollycoop
- fix: play death gong on death
- fix: detect player carried to den as missing so others can rest/travel
- feature: separate remix-based color picker for player2
- feature: save shelter of player2, wake up in that shelter

Self-sufficient coop mode
	done
		since most people play with latency, easier mode is nice to have
			shared food meter
			karma up (win) if ANY survived rather than ALL

		food conditions check and fix

		food at end of session
		food at start of session
			done and done!

		prevent gameover prompts

		Gates should work really well
			same logic as shelters? dead/Missing or there

		fix hunter start
		fix friend to offscreenden

	todo
		fix players input without jolly
			player 1 controls 1 and 2?
			study inptu system
		
		QOL minor stuff
			doesn't do the gong on death (gameover skipped but should still player the sfx)

		2-screen mode
			for double screens or ultra-wide

		menu
			player2 class dropdown
			preferred split mode dropdown
				actually do revise these requirements

		gates when player aten by lizor
			no workie

		fix realizer2
			game unloaded player 2 as it was being CARRIED into another room
				unreproduceable?
			I think I broke this with jolly, jolly doesn't handle players splitting up so restore real2 asap
				done?
	
		sleep (and wake up) in different shelters
			store shelter of player2
			place player2 in stored shelter
	
		karma flower spawn super buggy on player 2 dying

		Support remix custom colors

splitscreen
	smooth camera follow a little

	3 and 4 cameras

	custom colors when nojolly

Multiple displays
	It requires being in full screen, or will force full screen

	If this mode is active, the game should be in double-display mode, even in menus
		in menus ideally displays should be mirrored

	turning this mode on will force fullscreen and initialize a second display
	turning this mode on requires extra displays available
	if this mode is already on and there's no extra displays, revert to default split

	turning this mode off from the menu warns that a restart is required
